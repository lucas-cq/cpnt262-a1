### What Button?
To see the button please minimize the screen to mobile. The button will appear because of media queries. This button was fun to make. I started by watching a couple videos and taking on the challenge myself. That was a mistake. I had about 10 lines of code for something that only needed 4. Luckily I found out I could use transitions to make it one function.
